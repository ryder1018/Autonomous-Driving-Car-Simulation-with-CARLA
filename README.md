# Autonomous-Driving-Car-Simulation-with-CARLA

1. project goals
    - End-to-end learning: From a 640 × 480 RGB frame to 8 discrete control actions
    - Learned, not scripted: No way-points, no rule-based planner — collisions and speed define the reward.
    - Asynchronous training: Data collection runs in the main thread while a background thread updates the network, keeping the simulator busy 100 % of the time. 

2. key features
    - Replay buffer: 20 000 transitions with uniform sampling; starts learning after 5 000 stored steps.
    - ε-greedy exploration: ε decays from 1.0 → 0.1 with γ = 0.9975.
    - Target network: Synchronised every 10 optimisation steps to stabilise bootstrapping.
    - Speed-based reward: r = (v_kmh − 60) × 0.2, plus a −200 penalty for any collision.

3. some instructions
    - python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    - ./CarlaUE4.sh -RenderOffScreen -quality-level=Epic -world-port=3000 #Linux

    - python carla_dqn_train.py
        - (Checkpoints are saved to models/ whenever the worst reward over the last 10 episodes ≥ −200.)

    - tensorboard --logdir logs

    - python play_model.py --model-path models/your_checkpoint.model
